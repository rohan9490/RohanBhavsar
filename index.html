        <u><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a> is the name of the chip
            that was developed by Espressif Systems.</u><br>This provides Wi-Fi (and in
        some models)
        dual-mode Bluetooth connectivity to embedded devices.
        <i>ESP32 is technically just the chip</i>, modules and development boards that contain this chip are often also
        referred to as “ESP32” by the manufacturer.

        <em> PNP and NPN sensors do the same basic job, you might wonder why one would be used over another.</em>
        There are, in fact, some differences, and in most circuit design applications NPN transistors are preferred.
        This is due to the fact that the “N” substrate can transfer electrons significantly faster than “P” type
        substrates can transport positive electron holes.
        This presents a huge advantage in high-speed switching and amplifier circuits applications.
        Adding on to this advantage is the fact that NPN transistors are also easier, and thus cheaper, to
        manufacture
        than PNP transistors.
    </p>

    There are, however, certain circuits that benefit from PNP-type transistors, that would be difficult if not
    impossible to implement without this second type of transistor.
    One such application is a class B amplifier, where a matched pair of PNP and NPN transistors work in tandem in order
    to efficiently amplify oscillating signals. <br><br>

    <b>
        When designing a circuit, it’s extremely helpful to have this second type of switching option
        available.
